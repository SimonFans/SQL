Write an SQL query that reports the buyers who have bought S8 but not iPhone. Note that S8 and iPhone are products present in the Product table.

The query result format is in the following example:

Product table:
+------------+--------------+------------+
| product_id | product_name | unit_price |
+------------+--------------+------------+
| 1          | S8           | 1000       |
| 2          | G4           | 800        |
| 3          | iPhone       | 1400       |
+------------+--------------+------------+

Sales table:
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+
| seller_id | product_id | buyer_id | sale_date  | quantity | price |
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+
| 1         | 1          | 1        | 2019-01-21 | 2        | 2000  |
| 1         | 2          | 2        | 2019-02-17 | 1        | 800   |
| 2         | 1          | 3        | 2019-06-02 | 1        | 800   |
| 3         | 3          | 3        | 2019-05-13 | 2        | 2800  |
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+

Result table:
+-------------+
| buyer_id    |
+-------------+
| 1           |
+-------------+
The buyer with id 1 bought an S8 but didn't buy an iPhone. The buyer with id 3 bought both.


# solution1:

select 
    distinct s.buyer_id
from Sales s
join Product p
on s.product_id=p.product_id
where p.product_name='S8' 
and s.buyer_id not in (
    select 
        s1.buyer_id
    from Sales s1
    join Product p1
    on s1.product_id=p1.product_id
    where p1.product_name='iPhone'
)

# solution2:

SELECT s.buyer_id
FROM Sales AS s INNER JOIN Product AS p
ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY s.buyer_id
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN p.product_name = 'S8' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0
AND SUM(CASE WHEN p.product_name = 'iPhone' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0;
