In facebook, there is a follow table with two columns: followee, follower.

Please write a sql query to get the amount of each follower’s follower if he/she has one.

For example:

+-------------+------------+
| followee    | follower   |
+-------------+------------+
|     A       |     B      |
|     B       |     C      |
|     B       |     D      |
|     D       |     E      |
+-------------+------------+
should output:

+-------------+------------+
| follower    | num        |
+-------------+------------+
|     B       |  2         |
|     D       |  1         |
+-------------+------------+

Select f1.follower, count(distinct f2.follower) as num
from follow f1
inner join follow f2 on f1.follower = f2.followee
Group by f1.follower
